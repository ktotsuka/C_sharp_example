GUI program for an USB oscilloscope

I have built a 3 channel USB oscilloscope as a personal hobby project.  This code is for the GUI for the scope.  It can modify settings for the scope and plot the measured signals. 

"PlotItem" directory contains files to support plotting of integer or float data.  The plotting graphics were implemented using GDI+.

"NonPlotItem" directory contains files to support the numerical or check boxes that can display and manipulate integer and float variables

"MainApplication" directory contains files for everything else such as file manipulations, USB communications, capture settings, etc.

I have removed non-source code files for clarity

I also included some pictures in the "Pictures" directory so you will know what the USB oscilloscope looks like.  It has 3 probes for the 3 channels and a USB cable to connect to a PC.
